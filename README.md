This is a calendar for anything I do related to programming. Actually it is more of a journal than a typical calendar, because I only add things after they are done rather than before. It's good to keep a journal of what you do. Otherwise you might forget about little things you worked on that you'd like to come back to. It also will help you organize yourself mentally, and as we deal with a lot of complexity in programming, it's worth it.

I was using Google Calendar before, but I might want to have more control over my data. I also thought it would be interesting to make this public. Others might have interesting comments to add. What's the best way for you to comment if you have a comment? I'm not sure. There is a discord though: https://discord.gg/R2SpHy5fkc
